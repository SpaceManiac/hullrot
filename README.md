# Hullrot

**Hullrot** is a minimalist [Mumble](https://mumble.info/) server with
immersive integration with the online role-playing game
[Space Station 13](https://spacestation13.com/).

Features include:

* Local talk by default, so only others in vision range can hear you.
* Push-to-talk over any of the character's available radio channels.
* Handling of intercoms, holopad calls, and hot-miked radios.
* Headsets going inactive if station telecomms is disabled.

Hullrot requires integration with the game server to pass information back and
forth. For an example integration, grep for `hullrot` in
[our tgstation branch](https://github.com/AutomaticFrenzy/tgstation/).

Hullrot is still evolving. If you are interested in using it and the
documentation is insufficient, feel free to contact the author directly.
